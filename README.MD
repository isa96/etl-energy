# Oveview
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is a project to do a simple ETL. This project include these tech:

1. Python programming language
2. Docker
3. PostgreSQL

- [data dir](/data): contains all the data that is already downloaded from kaggel [Global Energy Statistics - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiljethwa/world-energy-statistics)
- [etl dir](/etl): contains all python scripts that is used to do ETL

# ETL (Extract, Transfrom and Load)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the step of ETL that I used:

1. Extract

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extract stage is used to extract data from data sources. Because in this database we only have one format of data, therefore I only use pandas library to extract data from csv into data frame and return that data frame.

2. Transform

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this transform stage, I used python to transform data to what I need, what I did is:

    - I remove the unnecessary columns. In this case I only used the column [Continent, Country, and the last column of the file].
    - Remove missing values from the dataset using .dropna() function from pandas
    - Because the data type of the last column is float and has many number after comma, then I transform to round up the value therefore the value only has 2 number after comma
    - After transform the values of the last column I create new data frame for transformed column and replace the old column with the new transformed column

3. Load

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Load stage is used to load the data that has been transformed to the data warehouse or database. In this case I used PostgreSQL with docker image that I will explain more later in docker section. I used psycopg2 to help me connect python with PostgreSQL. Not just that, I also used argparse to help me create command arguments in python therefore, I can input csv file, database name, host name, username, password, and port of PostgreSQL flexibly.

# How To Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Create volume name **etl_energy_consumption** with this command ```docker volume create etl_energy_consumption```
3. PostgreSQL using this path to save their data in docker */var/lib/postgresql/data*. Therefore if you want to use volume then the path of your volume will be like this ```[your volume name]:/var/lib/postgresql/data```. So the volume will be like this ```etl_energy_consumption:/var/lib/postgresql``` 
4. Pull postgres image from docker using this command line ```docker pull postgres```
5. create network for docker by using this command line ```docker network create energy_consumption_network```
6. Pull pgadmin in docker using this command line ```docker pull dpage/pgadmin4```
7. Run docker compose using this command line ```docker-compose up -d```

```
NOTE:
If you want to connect docker with network you cannot used localhost, but you have to see the IP of the connection using:

docker network inspect [network name]

Then you will see the IP of the connection

or you can just use name of the container to connect each container
```

**This is the image of your pgadmin configuration**

8. install pgcli to see your PostgreSQL from command line ```pip install pgcli```
9. Run this to access PostgreSQL from command line ```pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u postgres -d energy_consumption```
10. Build image for our etl script by running this command ```docker build -t python-etl .```
11. Go to [etl dir](/etl) and run 
```
docker run -it --network=energy_consumption_network python-etl -f [file-path] -db energy_consumption -hs localhost -u postgres -pass 123456 -p 5432
```
12. Then ETL process will completed 👍👨🏻‍💻
